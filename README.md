**Tools & Frameworks**:  
`Python` | `scikit-learn` | `TensorFlow` | `Keras` | `Pandas` | `NumPy` | `Matplotlib` | `Seaborn` | `Google Colab` | `Jupyter Notebook`

### 🔍 What I Learned:
- **Foundations of AI/ML**: Types of ML, applications, tools
- **Python for ML**: NumPy, Pandas, data visualization
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding, normalization
- **Supervised Learning**: Linear & Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes
- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means Clustering, PCA, t-SNE
- **Model Evaluation & Tuning**: Cross-validation, GridSearch, Regularization
- **Deep Learning**: CNNs, RNNs, LSTM, Sentiment Analysis
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Text Classification
- **Model Deployment**: Using Flask/Streamlit and exporting with Pickle
